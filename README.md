# stairspeedtest
A small script that can test the stairs' download speed, packet loss and latency. Supports single ss/ssr/v2ray links and their subscribe links.
## Usage
* JUST RUN THE SCRIPT, PASTE THE LINK AND GO!
* Results for subscribe link tests will be saved to a log file in the root folder.
## Thanks
**This script is inspired by [NyanChanMeow](https://github.com/NyanChanMeow)'s original script [SSRSpeed](https://github.com/NyanChanMeow/SSRSpeed). From which I have learned quite a lot on how to rewrite the code, and it has provoded me with some critical information. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD-WORKING!!**
## Known Bugs
* Currently does not support http obfs in vmess link.
* If encryption method is *chacha20* in ssr link, ssr client will crash and no speedtest result will be displayed.
## Future functions
* Will add fast.com speedtest soon
