# Stair Speedtest
A small script that can test the stairs' download speed, packet loss and latency. Supports single ss/ssr/v2ray links and their subscribe links.  
## Usage
* Download the latest release and unzip it, then run "speedtest.bat" for CLI speedtest, run "webgui.bat" for Web GUI speedtest.
* Results for subscribe link tests will be saved to a log file in "results" folder.
* The result will be exported into a PNG file with the result log. An interactive HTML file with test results will also be generated with the PNG file. In this HTML, you can sort by name, ping, packet loss or average speed.
* You can customize some settings by editing "pref.ini".
## Thanks
**This script is inspired by [NyanChanMeow](https://github.com/NyanChanMeow)'s original script [SSRSpeed](https://github.com/NyanChanMeow/SSRSpeed). From which I have learned quite a lot on how to rewrite the code, and it has provoded me with some critical information. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD-WORKING!!**
